# PixAI Discord Bot – Fresh Development Instructions

This repository is being rebooted. The entire legacy implementation now lives in [`_archived/`](./_archived/). Use the guidance below when making changes:

- ✅ Focus new development at the repository root (outside `_archived/`).
- 🚫 Do **not** modify or delete files inside `_archived/` unless the task explicitly permits it.
- 📝 Keep this file and the root `README.md` updated with any high-level decisions or structural changes introduced during the rebuild.

If you need historical context, browse the materials in `_archived/` but leave them unchanged.
