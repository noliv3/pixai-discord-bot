# PixAI Discord Bot – Fresh Start

The previous iteration of the PixAI Discord bot has been moved into [`_archived/`](./_archived/) so that development can begin on a brand new bot implementation.

## Repository Layout

- `_archived/` – contains the full source code and documentation for the legacy PixAI Discord bot. Treat it as read-only unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- *(to be added)* – new bot source files will live at the repository root as the rebuild progresses.

## Getting Started

1. Review the legacy implementation under `_archived/` if you need context or to port functionality.
2. Implement the new bot in the root of the repository, keeping `_archived/` untouched.
3. Update this README as new components are added to the fresh implementation.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Do not modify files under `_archived/` unless specifically asked.
- Document new features and decisions in this README so future contributors have up-to-date guidance.
